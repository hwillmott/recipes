Preset oven to 325 F

Dried fruits:

1/2 c. raisins
1/2 c. cranberries
1/2 c. Inca berries
1/2 c. chopped apricots
1/4 c. blueberries

Nuts & seeds:

2/3 c. shredded coconut
2/3 c. pistachios
1/2 c. chopped walnuts
1/2 c. sliced almonds
1/2 c. pumpkin seeds

2 c. oats? I actually never know how much I put in. I just pour and stir until it reaches an oats:everything-else ratio I find acceptable

Lubricant:

1/2 c. honey
1/2 c. flavourless oil (e.g. canola oil, avocado oil, maybe vegetable oil)
splash of vanilla

All of the above amount are wild approximations. I just go to the bulk section of the co-op near our place and get a scoopful of everything that intrigues me and it ends up turning out pretty well. Use your intuition.

1. Stir all the dry stuff together.
2. Heat up the lubricant (haha) in the microwave for a few seconds just so the honey isn't a giant glob in the middle of your oats that's hard to stir in.
3. Stir the lubricant in.
4. Put it on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.
5. Put it in the oven.
6. Stir every 10 minutes or so until it's golden and lovely.
7. Let it cool in the tray and then put it into whatever container you desire. Will last in the cupboard probably forever, but I have never tested that hypothesis because I eat so much of it.
