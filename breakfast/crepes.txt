This is actually a pancake batter that I stirred until it was thin enough to make something that resembled crèpes. If that doesn't work, just add more milk. The important player is the toppings.

Pancakes:

1 c. flour
1 tbsp sugar
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1 c. milk
1 egg
2-3 tbsp melted butter (melt in the frying pan you're going to use)
1/2 tsp vanilla

Instructions: 

1. Mix the dry ingredients together
2. Mix the wet ingredients together
3. Mix everything together
4. Cook these on a lightly-greased frying pan (smudge of butter on a paper towel works great. wipe down for each crèpe) on medium-low heat, about 1/3 c. per crèpe

IMPORTANT RULE: throw out the first one. I'm sorry, but it's traditional and kind of important. The first one will probably burn or not cook quickly enough because you set the temperature wrong or waited too long, and the crèpe will absorb the flavour of whatever you last cooked on that frying pan, so it will taste weird. Mourn and move on.

Toppings (in any combination):

sliced strawberries
sliced banana
blackberries
blackberry jam
lemon juice with a sprinkling of sugar
nutella
maple syrup but that's more of a pancake thing

Pretty much everyone has a recipe for pancakes, so this really isn't necessary. I just wanted to post a picture of my breakfast.
