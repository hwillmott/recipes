1 gallon milk
1 c. existing yoghurt

* should use a dutch oven because it needs to stay warm for quite a while. If you don't have one, you can wrap the pot you're using in a towel to insulate it

1. Heat up the yoghurt to 93 C
2. Cool down to 45 C
3. Mix some milk with the existing yoghurt to thin, then stir it into the milk
4. Cover the pot and put it in the oven (turned off) with the light on. Leave overnight.
5. Decant into pots and put in the fridge to set/chill
