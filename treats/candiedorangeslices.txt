Orange Slices:

1 orange, sliced about 1/3" thick (not wedges)
1 1/2 c. water
1/2 c. sugar

1. Put the sugar and the water in a wide frying pan on the stove on medium heat
2. When the sugar water starts to bubble, add the orange slices. The mixture should be bubbling gently - not violently enough to break apart the orange slices
3. Flip every now in then until the water is almost completely evaporated and remove the orange slices. Place them on wax paper to cool.

Homemade Chocolate:

1/2 c. coconut oil
1/2 c. cocoa
1/4 c. mixture of honey and maple syrup
splash of vanilla

Note: I am considering using the leftover orange syrup to sweeten and flavour (in lieu of honey/maple syrup) the chocolate. Haven't tried it yet, but it would probably be awesome

1. Put the coconut oil in your smallest saucepan on low heat
2. Whisk continuously until it is only just melted (should go completely clear)
2. Add everything else and whisk together. Take off heat.

The Unification:

1. Dip the orange slices in the chocolate. Set back on the wax paper and put in the fridge to set.
2. Pour the leftover chocolate into a shallow, wax-paper-lined dish and put in the fridge.

This chocolate goes pretty soft at room temperature, so keep your treats in the fridge (or the freezer if it's plain chocolate).
