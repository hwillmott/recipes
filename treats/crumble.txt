1 c. oats
1 c. flour
1 c. brown sugar
1 c. butter

cinnamon
1 lemon
3 apples
3 pears
1 c. raisins

The fruit part:
1. peel and cut apples and pears into thumb-sized pieces, put in casserole dish
2. squeeze lemon juice on top
3. sprinkle a bit of cinnamon on there
4. mix it all around with your hands
5. taste it and maybe add more cinnamon if you're digging it
6. optionally sprinkle some brown sugar on top

The crumble part:
1. cut the butter into little chunks (1 cm cubes are great but it's not a big deal) and put in a big bowl for mixing
2. put the oats, flour, and brown sugar in there
3. combine these ingredients with either a pastry cutter or your hands (my preference). If you're using your hands, the best way to mix is by squishing the butter between your fingers so it can break up into smaller pieces and combine with the other ingredients. Mix until it's a pretty homogenous blob and maybe add a bit more flour if it doesn't break easily into crumbs.
4. sprinkle/spread this mixture on top of your fruit

Baking:
1. preheat oven to 375 F
2. bake for about 20-30 minutes or until the crumble becomes golden and a little dark in places. If the fruit isn't cooked to your liking, you can loosely cover with aluminum foil for 5-10 minutes and this will bring the juices out. Don't seal it completely because nobody likes a soggy crumble

Deviations and other ideas:
1. blackberry & lime is a great combo (no cinnamon)
2. strawberry, rhubarb, & lemon is also great
3. peach & raspberry
4. plums & cinnamon
5. can put nuts in the crumble part if you're getting fancy (walnuts & pecans)
