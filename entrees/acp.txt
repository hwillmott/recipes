This dish is lovingly referred to in my family as "ACP", or "Auntie Carolyn's Pasta"

Ingredients:
1. Vine tomatoes (a pound?)
2. Garlic (3 cloves?)
3. Olive oil (2 tablespoons?)
4. Feta cheese (more than you think you need)
5. Basil, parsley (a handful each)
6. Pasta (use quinoa pasta if you want some extra protein)

Steps:
1. Get a pot of water on the stove on high for your pasta
2. Quarter the tomatoes
3. Roughly mince/chop the garlic
4. Put a frying pan on medium with some olive oil
5. Add the tomatoes + garlic
6. Pasta might be in the water by now
7. Let the tomatoes simmer gently
8. Break up the feta and roughly chop the basil and parsley
9. When the pasta is done, drain it, put it back in the now empty pot, and add everything else. Stir until it's decently combined
10. Serve with parmesan and maybe some salt + pepper

There are no amounts in this recipe because I improvise it every time. You'll know what seems right.
