Ingredients:
olive oil
5-ish garlic cloves (minced)
a couple tablespoons of parsley (minced)
1-2 lb. Manila clams
1 cup white wine
spaghetti

Instructions:
1. Start some water boiling for the pasta. 
2. When you put the pasta in the boiling water (timing varies from stove-to-stove, not a big deal), start heating up the widest saucepan you have (needs to fit everything at end) on medium-high heat . 
3. When the wide saucepan is hot, pour a few tablespoons of olive oil in there, let it heat up briefly, then throw in the garlic and some of the parsley and let it sizzle a little but not brown, then throw in (gently) the clams and then the white wine. 
4. Shuffle the pan a little so you look like a pro. 
5. Cover with a lid. The clams will be done when they open (any clams that do not open when steamed should not be eaten). 
6. Hopefully at this point, you've drained your pasta and can now throw it into the wide saucepan with the clams. Add the rest of the parsley. Stir everything around and then serve. You can also drizzle more olive oil onto your pasta at any point and it would probably be a good thing. I keep a bottle on the table with the salt + pepper.
