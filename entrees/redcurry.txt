In this order, in a wok or abnormally large sauce pan on medium-high:

1. Vegetable oil 
2. Chicken (2 breasts, 1-inch pieces)
.. a few minutes pass
3. 1 Onion (quartered, sliced)
4. 2 Carrots (sliced)
.. more time passes (how much?! OMG)
5. Red curry paste (usually comes in small can or jar)
6. A dollop of peanut butter
7. Some Sriracha or Sambal Oelek (you can always add more, but you can't add less)
8. 1 can coconut milk
9. 1 can bamboo shoots
10. A handful of snap peas (or whatever those things are) 
11. 4 mushrooms (sliced)
.. a couple minutes pass
12. 1 bell pepper (1-inch slices)
.. let it bubble until the pepper is soft enough

Serve on rice with lime juice and cilantro on top.

The timing is kinda hard because vegetables cook at different rates. I put them in the right order (probably?!), but the cooking times are vague because I've never timed it and I actually don't know. You'll figure it out.
