Disclaimer: I made this recipe up based on a traditional Persian dish and didn't measure anything, so the quantities are approximate

Ingredients:
5 chicken thighs, bone-in, skin-on
1 1/2 c. whole walnuts
10 prunes
2/3 c. olive oil
1/3 c. pomegranate molasses
1/4 c. red wine vinegar
1/2 tsp turmeric
1/4 tsp cinnamon
salt + pepper
1 bay leaf
1 lemon

1. Mix everything except the lemon in a bowl together and leave to marinade for 12-24 hours
2. preheat oven to 375
3. dump everything into a casserole dish (preferably cast iron) and let it come to room temperature
4. squeeze the juice of half the lemon onto the chicken
5. bake until ready (maybe this took 45 minutes? I use a meat thermometer (chicken is done at 75 celsius)

Things you could serve with it:
Saffron rice
yoghurt with wilted spinach
rosted beet salad
