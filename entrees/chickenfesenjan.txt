Disclaimer: this is my adaptation of a traditional Persian recipe

Ingredients:
5 chicken thighs, bone-in, skin-on
1 1/2 c. whole walnuts
10 prunes
2/3 c. olive oil
1/3 c. pomegranate molasses
1/4 c. red wine vinegar
2 tsp turmeric
2 tsp cinnamon
salt + pepper
1 bay leaf

1. Mix all these things in a bowl together and leave to marinade for 12-24 hours
2. preheat oven to 375
3. dump everything into a casserole dish (preferably cast iron)
4. bake until ready (maybe this took 45 minutes? I use a meat thermometer (chicken is done at 75 celsius)

Serve with saffron rice, roasted zucchini, and yoghurt with dill.
