(Next time, experiment):
1 lb gr. beef
2 slices bacon
1 onion
1 carrot
1 stalk celery
10 crimini mushrooms
italian herbs
diced tomatos, tomato sauce, tomato paste
dash of wine
rind of parmesan

Current recipe:
Ingredients (separated into chronological chunks):
olive oil
2 tbsp dried oregano
4 slices of thick bacon, cut into pieces

2 medium onions, minced
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 carrots, grated
1 zucchini, grated
2 celery stalks, minced
4-5 crimini mushrooms, minced
a small bunch of fresh basil (pick off the leaves and mince up the stalks)

1 lb ground beef
1 lb sausage meat
2 bay leaves
salt and pepper
2 14 oz. cans diced tomatoes
1 14 oz. can tomato sauce
a couple tablespoons of tomato paste
a dash of Worcestershire sauce
1/2 c. of red wine (or however much you want to add)
a chunk of parmesan 

Steps:
1. Prepare all the vegetables
2. Put a few tablespoons of olive oil into some kind of (large) casserole/stock pot type dish on the stove on medium high
3. When it gets hot, add the bacon and the oregano and stir occasionally until the bacon starts to golden
4. Add all the veggies and stir every 30-ish seconds until the vegetables have gone soft and maybe are getting some colour (about 7 minutes)
5. Add everything else, except the basil leaves! Break up the meat in the pot and add more water if you think it will be too dry (probably won't, though). Stir everything all around and bring it up to a boil, then cover with a lid and let simmer (as low as possible) for an hour or so. Simmering for longer isn't really a big deal so this makes dinner timing easily.
6. When it's time for dinner, try to recover the chunk of parmesan and the bay leaves, then stir in the basil leaves (rip them if they're big).

This makes quite a lot of spaghetti sauce, so you can freeze some for dinners later or maybe just eat spaghetti every night for a month.
